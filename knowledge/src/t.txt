FASB > ASC 842-30-30-1 specifies that for a capital lease, "the lessee shall measure a lease liability and a right-of-use asset initially at an amount equal to the present value of payments to be made over the lease term, with the present value determined at the lease commencement date." This includes "minimum lease payments, any guaranteed residual value, any exercise price at the end of the lease term to purchase the underlying asset, and payments in lieu of taxes or insurance." The discounted rate used to calculate the present value should be the incremental borrowing rate of the lessee, or the rate implicit in the lease if that can be readily determined and is lower. 

Once the lease liability and right-of-use asset are initially measured, the lease liability should be reduced as lease payments are made, and interest expense should be recognized on the lease liability using the effective interest method. The right-of-use asset should be amortized over the lease term using the straight-line method, subject to impairment if necessary. 

In summary, a lessee should recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset for a capital lease under ASC 842, and make subsequent adjustments to these balances as necessary based on lease payments and interest calculations.
